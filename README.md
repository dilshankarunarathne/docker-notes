# Docker 

A platform for building, running and shipping apllications on a consistant manner.

Have you ever been in a situation where, your application works on your local machine, but fails on another...?
Reasons:
	* One or more files are missing in deployment
	* Software version mismatch on the target machine
	* Different configuration settings & environment variables 

With Docker, you can easily package your applications with anything they need.
